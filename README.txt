Description:

This project is small and simple example for getting response from openweathermap api
to display the hours when the temperature is more than twenty degrees for the next five hours 
and the number of sunny hours

Usage:

1. Build the project openweathermap
2. Validate the api using WeatherTest.java as a standalone java program
3. Change the zip code while calling the class OpenWeatherMap constructor

Eg. OpenWeatherMap openWeatherMap = new OpenWeatherMap("2000,au");
OpenWeatherMap openWeatherMap = new OpenWeatherMap("2145,au");
OpenWeatherMap openWeatherMap = new OpenWeatherMap("2150,au");
